I loved your background Jerie!! It was really cool being able to look at your css and see how simple it can be to apply the gradient. The on and off button is really neat because the colors default when "off" gets pressed plus the simplicity of the layout and button placements keeps it looking sleek. I really love what you did and look forward to seeing more of your work in the future Jerie!!
